# ECE 475 4bit BCD Counter Part2
Lab 3
Authors: Rachel & Danya

The objective was for students to learn how to use the Logic Analyzer provided in the lab.
This device displays the real-time outputs of the VHDL code implemented on the development board.
The logic analyzer is a necessary alternative to the Xilinx generated waveforms, in some situations.

Equipment Used:
Xilinx IDE, iSim, iMPACT
ML501 Xilinx board with Virtex-5 LX Xilinx chip
Logi Analyzer

A 4-bit binary down counter was designed using structural modeling. 
Our counter from the last lab was designed using some behavioral modeling, so we had
to create a new structural version of that design that counted backward from 1111 to 0000.

It was learned during the previous lab, that Xilinx has some trouble with JK flip-flops
when defined structurally. Therefore, D flip-flops were used instead. 

The design was tested by generating a waveform in Xilinx first.
An RTL schematic was also generated by Xilinx.
Then, the design was implemented on the development board.
The logic analyzer was connected to the 4 mapped output pins on the board, and the grounding pin.

The logic analyzer, once the settings were configured the way we wanted, displayed a waveform 
that confirmed the functionality of the design. the waveform matched our expected results.
